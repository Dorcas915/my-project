Smart Farm API

A Flask-based REST API that supports smart farming operations such as monitoring sensors, managing crops, irrigation schedules, and weather data.
The API stores information in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

This project includes logging, error handling, observability features, and documentation.
The application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for easier deployment.
